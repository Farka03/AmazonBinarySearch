An interesting challenge from Amazon:

There is a binary array of size 6*5 consisting of different numbers. Each row and each column of the matrix is in ascending order. It is necessary to find 14 among all the numbers.

Solution:

You can use a binary search to solve, since the columns and rows are in ascending order. There are other methods as well, but this is one of the possible ones. You can also iterate over the entire array in search of an element, but this is long.
